To run this project locally and connect to the two databases, set environmental variables by creating .env.test and .env.development files, each including PGDATABASE=database_name (see /db/setup.sql for the database names).

Make sure these .env.\* files are .gitignored to avoid accidentally pushing any sensitive information about our database and/or postgres passwords up to github.
